# Smartparens [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Fuco1/smartparens.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Fuco1/smartparens) [![Paypal logo](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=CEYP5YVHDRX8C)

Smartparens is minor mode for Emacs that *deals with parens pairs and tries to be smart about it*. It started as a unification effort to combine functionality of several existing packages in a single, compatible and extensible way to deal with parentheses, delimiters, tags and the like. Some of these packages include [autopair](https://github.com/capitaomorte/autopair), [textmate](http://code.google.com/p/emacs-textmate/), [wrap-region](https://github.com/rejeep/wrap-region), [electric-pair-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElectricPair), [paredit](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit) and others. With the basic features found in other packages it also brings many improvements as well as completely new features. [Here's][wiki-what] a highlight of some features, for a complete list and detailed documentation look in the [manual][wiki-new].

# Default configuration

The default configuration was moved into a separate file. If you wish to use the default configuration as a basis for your own additional customization, add:

```scheme
(require 'smartparens-config)
```

in your configuration files (e.g. init.el) to load it. There are also files with additional configuration for specific modes, such as `smartparens-latex.el`. The usage is similar as with the default config. Note however that the `smartparens-config.el` file will auto-load all the mode-speceific customizations.

# Support the project

If you want to support this project, you can do it in the following ways:

* Contribute code. If you have an idea that is not yet implemented and will benefit smartparens, feel free to implement it and submit a pull request. If you have any concerns whether your contribution will be accepted, ask beforehand. You can email the author or [start an issue](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/new) on the tracker.
* Contribute ideas. Even if you can't code Emacs LISP, you can still contribute valuable ideas for other programmers to implement. Simply [start new issue](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/new) on the tracker and submit your suggestion.
* You can make a [financial donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=CEYP5YVHDRX8C) through PayPal. I currently major in mathematics, having no full-time job as the school (and emacs :) eats most my day time. If you like smartparens or want a specific feature to be implemented and can spare a modest amount on a donation, feel free to do so. Regardless of the donations, smartparens will always be free both as in beer and as in speech.
