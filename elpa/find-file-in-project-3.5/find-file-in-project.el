;;; Commentary:

;; This program provides a couple methods for quickly finding any file
;; in a given project.  It depends on GNU find.

;; A project is found by searching up the directory tree until a file
;; is found that matches `ffip-project-file'.  (".git" by default.)
;; You can set `ffip-project-root-function' to provide an alternate
;; function to search for the project root.  By default, it looks only
;; for files whose names match `ffip-patterns',

;; If you have so many files that it becomes unwieldy, you can set
;; `ffip-find-options' to a string which will be passed to the `find'
;; invocation in order to exclude irrelevant subdirectories/files.
;; For instance, in a Ruby on Rails project, you are interested in all
;; .rb files that don't exist in the "vendor" directory.  In that case
;; you could set `ffip-find-options' to "-not -regex \".*vendor.*\"".

;; All these variables may be overridden on a per-directory basis in
;; your .dir-locals.el.  See (info "(Emacs) Directory Variables") for
;; details.

;; Ivy.el from https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper could be automatically
;; used if you insert below line into ~/.emacs,
;;   (autoload 'ivy-read "ivy")
;; In Ivy.el, SPACE is translated to regex ".*".
;; For exmaple, the search string "dec fun pro" is transformed into
;; a regex "\\(dec\\).*\\(fun\\).*\\(pro\\)"
;;
;; If Ivy.el is not available, ido will be used.

;; GNU Find can be installed,
;;   - through `brew' on OS X
;;   - through `cygwin' on Windows.

;; This program works on Windows/Cygwin/Linux/Mac Emacs.
